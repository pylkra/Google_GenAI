## 🧠 Gemini-powered Mental Health Assistant
A warm, supportive chatbot designed to help users manage anxiety, stress, and low mood — powered by Google’s Gemini model and CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) techniques.

**🌟 Overview**
Mental health matters. This AI assistant is designed to offer empathetic, informative conversations that follow core principles of CBT. It also uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to surface relevant, high-quality information tailored to each user's needs.

Whether you're having a rough day or just need someone to talk to, this assistant is here to help — thoughtfully and respectfully.
